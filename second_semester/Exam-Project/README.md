## **Question**

You are required to deploy the same Laravel application from your mini project. This time, the entire deployment steps including installation of packages and dependencies, configuring your apache webserver etc, will be defined in an ansible playbook and deployed to atleast one ansible slave.
You should also write a bash script that would install and set up postgresql. This bash script would be run on your ansible slaves using an ansible playbook.

## **Requirements**

1. We should be able to access your deployment using a domain name of your choice(not an IP address).

2. We should be able to test all the endpoints without errors.

3. Your base url may or may not display the default Laravel page.

4. These must be done on virtual machines on any cloud provider of your choice(any Linux distro of your choice).

5. Your application must be encrypted with TLS/SSL.

6. You may or may not define a logical network on the cloud, but extra efforts would be rewarded.
